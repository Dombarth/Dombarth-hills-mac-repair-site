{# Section 4: Common Mac Repairs We See - 3-5 scenario paragraphs #}
<section class="common-repairs-section">
<h2>Common Mac Repairs We See from {{ suburb.name }}</h2>

{% if suburb.slug == "castle-hill" or suburb.slug == "baulkham-hills" or suburb.slug == "bella-vista" %}
<p>We frequently see MacBooks from {{ suburb.name }} with battery health issues caused by age and daily charging cycles, particularly on Intel based models still in regular use. Many local professionals rely on their MacBook Pro for work and notice the battery no longer lasting through meetings.</p>

<p>Display damage is also common, often related to transport or accidental pressure on the lid. These cases usually require full panel replacement rather than glass only repair.</p>

<p>For iMacs and Mac minis, storage upgrades and thermal servicing are frequent requests where systems have slowed down over time. Fusion Drive failures on older iMacs are something we handle regularly.</p>

<p>Logic board issues come in from {{ suburb.name }} when Macs stop charging or wont turn on. We diagnose at component level to determine if repair is practical.</p>

{% elif suburb.slug == "cherrybrook" or suburb.slug == "carlingford" or suburb.slug == "pennant-hills" or suburb.slug == "west-pennant-hills" %}
<p>MacBooks from {{ suburb.name }} students often come in with keyboard issues from heavy use, or screens damaged during transport to school. We see a lot of MacBook Airs in this area.</p>

<p>Battery replacements are common on devices that have been used through several years of study. The original battery typically degrades after 500 to 800 charge cycles.</p>

<p>Data recovery requests come through when drives fail before assignments are backed up. We prioritise these cases understanding the urgency for students.</p>

<p>For home office setups, iMac thermal issues and SSD upgrades are frequent. Older iMacs with spinning hard drives benefit significantly from solid state upgrades.</p>

{% elif suburb.slug == "dural" or suburb.slug == "galston" or suburb.slug == "glenhaven" or suburb.slug == "annangrove" or suburb.slug == "middle-dural" %}
<p>Rural property owners from {{ suburb.name }} often use Macs for property management and home businesses. We see MacBooks with dust ingress affecting fans and thermal performance.</p>

<p>Power related issues are more common in semi rural areas where power fluctuations can affect charging circuits. We repair MacBooks that wont charge or show erratic battery behaviour.</p>

<p>iMacs used in sheds or workshops sometimes develop display issues from temperature extremes. We assess whether repair or replacement makes more sense.</p>

<p>Data recovery is particularly important for {{ suburb.name }} customers running businesses from home where records may not be backed up to cloud services.</p>

{% elif suburb.slug == "norwest" or suburb.slug == "blacktown" or suburb.slug == "seven-hills" %}
<p>Business users from {{ suburb.name }} bring in MacBooks needing fast turnaround. Keyboard failures and battery issues are common on machines in constant professional use.</p>

<p>Display repairs come through regularly, often from devices transported between office and home. Cracked screens and backlight issues are typical.</p>

<p>USB C port problems affect MacBook Pros used with docking stations and multiple peripherals. We repair and replace damaged Thunderbolt ports.</p>

<p>For offices with iMacs, SSD upgrades transform slow machines into responsive workstations. This is often more practical than replacement for older Intel models.</p>

{% elif suburb.slug == "kellyville" or suburb.slug == "north-kellyville" or suburb.slug == "kellyville-ridge" or suburb.slug == "the-ponds" or suburb.slug == "stanhope-gardens" %}
<p>Young families in {{ suburb.name }} often have multiple Macs in the household. We see MacBook Airs used for school and MacBook Pros for working parents.</p>

<p>Liquid damage is unfortunately common with children around. Coffee spills, juice, and water damage all come through our workshop from this area.</p>

<p>Screen repairs are frequent, particularly on MacBook Airs where the display is more vulnerable to accidental damage.</p>

<p>iMac storage upgrades are popular for family computers that have become slow over years of photos, videos, and applications accumulating.</p>
