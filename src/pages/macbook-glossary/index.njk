<h1>MacBook Repair Glossary</h1>

<p class="lead">Mac repair involves technical terminology that can be confusing if you're not familiar with it. This glossary explains common terms you might encounter when researching MacBook problems or discussing repairs. Understanding these terms helps you make informed decisions about your Mac.</p>

<section class="glossary-index">
<h2>Common Terms</h2>

<div class="glossary-list">

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>DFU Mode</h3>
<p>Device Firmware Update mode. A deep recovery state that allows a Mac to be restored even when normal recovery methods fail. Used primarily on Apple Silicon and T2 Macs when the firmware or operating system is severely corrupted.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Flexgate</h3>
<p>A common term for the display cable issue affecting certain 2016-2018 MacBook Pro models. The display flex cable runs through the hinge and can wear out over time, causing backlight problems or display failure. Named for the flexible cable involved.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Kernel Panic</h3>
<p>A critical system error that forces macOS to stop completely. When a kernel panic occurs, you'll see a message telling you to restart your computer. Can be caused by hardware failures, incompatible software, or severe system corruption.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Logic Board</h3>
<p>The main circuit board in a Mac containing the processor, memory controllers, and most core components. Apple's term for what's called a motherboard in other computers. Logic board failure can cause various symptoms depending on which components are affected.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>SMC (System Management Controller)</h3>
<p>A chip in Intel Macs that controls low-level functions like power management, thermal management, and battery charging. SMC issues can cause power problems, fan issues, or unexpected shutdowns. Resetting the SMC can sometimes resolve these issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Swollen Battery</h3>
<p>A battery that has expanded due to internal chemical degradation. Swelling occurs when gases build up inside the battery cells. A swollen battery is a safety concern and should be replaced promptly. Signs include a raised trackpad, gaps in the case, or a MacBook that doesn't sit flat.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>T2 Chip</h3>
<p>A security chip found in Intel Macs from 2018-2020. Handles encryption, secure boot, and other security functions. The T2 chip affects how recovery and data access work on these models.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>NVRAM/PRAM</h3>
<p>Non-volatile memory that stores certain settings even when the Mac is off. Includes display settings, startup disk selection, and other parameters. Resetting NVRAM can resolve some startup and display issues.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Thermal Throttling</h3>
<p>When a Mac intentionally slows down the processor to reduce heat generation. Occurs when internal temperatures get too high. Causes performance issues but protects the Mac from heat damage.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)</h3>
<p>The component that generates images for the display. Some Macs have integrated graphics (part of the main processor) while others have discrete graphics (a separate chip). GPU failures cause display problems, artifacts, or boot failures.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>SSD (Solid State Drive)</h3>
<p>The storage device in modern Macs. Uses flash memory with no moving parts, unlike older hard drives. SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs but can still fail and have limited write cycles.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Safe Mode</h3>
<p>A startup mode that loads only essential macOS components. Useful for troubleshooting because it bypasses third-party software and extensions. If problems disappear in Safe Mode, software conflicts are likely the cause.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>Recovery Mode</h3>
<p>A special startup environment for repairing macOS, reinstalling the operating system, or restoring from backup. Access by holding specific keys during startup (varies by Mac type). Essential for troubleshooting and repair.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>FileVault</h3>
<p>Apple's full-disk encryption system. When enabled, your entire drive is encrypted and requires your password to access. FileVault affects data recovery approaches and requires your password or recovery key for any data access.</p>
</div>

<div class="glossary-item">
<h3>TRIM</h3>
<p>A command that tells SSDs which data blocks are no longer in use. Helps maintain SSD performance but makes some data recovery more difficult because deleted data is actively cleared.</p>
</div>
