<h1>Kernel Panic</h1>

<p class="definition">A kernel panic is a critical system error where macOS encounters a problem so severe it cannot safely continue operating. When this happens, your Mac displays a message telling you to restart your computer, and normal operation stops completely.</p>

<h2>What a Kernel Panic Looks Like</h2>

<p>When a kernel panic occurs, you'll typically see a dark overlay appear across your screen with a message in multiple languages telling you to hold down the power button to restart. The message starts with "Your computer restarted because of a problem." On older Macs, you might see the text displayed on a grey background.</p>

<p>The Mac will not respond to any input other than holding the power button to force a restart. You cannot save work or exit normally during a kernel panic.</p>

<h2>Why Kernel Panics Happen</h2>

<p>The kernel is the core of macOS that manages fundamental operations. When something goes wrong that the kernel cannot handle, it panics and stops rather than risk data corruption or hardware damage.</p>

<p>Common causes include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hardware failures, particularly RAM and logic board issues</li>
  <li>Incompatible or corrupted kernel extensions (drivers)</li>
  <li>Severe software conflicts</li>
  <li>Failing storage drives</li>
  <li>Overheating causing component malfunction</li>
  <li>Power delivery problems</li>
</ul>

<h2>When to Be Concerned</h2>

<p>A single kernel panic can happen occasionally and isn't necessarily cause for alarm. It might be a one-time software glitch. However, recurring kernel panics are a warning sign.</p>

<p>If you experience kernel panics frequently (more than once a week) or if they happen consistently under certain conditions (like when using specific software or when the Mac gets warm), this usually indicates an underlying problem that needs diagnosis.</p>

<h2>What You Can Try</h2>

<p>After a kernel panic, check what you were doing when it occurred. If it happens repeatedly:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Update macOS and all applications</li>
  <li>Boot in Safe Mode to check if third-party extensions are causing issues</li>
  <li>Remove recently installed software or drivers</li>
  <li>Check for adequate storage space</li>
  <li>Run Apple Diagnostics to check for hardware issues</li>
</ul>

<h2>When Professional Help Is Needed</h2>

<p>If kernel panics persist after basic troubleshooting, or if Apple Diagnostics reports errors, professional diagnosis is recommended. Recurring kernel panics often indicate hardware problems that won't resolve on their own and may worsen over time.</p>
