<h1>Logic Board</h1>

<p class="definition">The logic board is the main circuit board in a Mac, containing the processor (CPU), graphics processor (GPU), memory controllers, and most of the core electronics. Apple uses the term "logic board" rather than "motherboard" which is common in the PC world.</p>

<h2>What the Logic Board Does</h2>

<p>The logic board is essentially the heart and brain of your Mac combined. It contains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The processor that runs all your software</li>
  <li>Graphics processing for your display</li>
  <li>Memory management circuits</li>
  <li>Power management and charging circuits</li>
  <li>Input/output controllers for ports, keyboard, trackpad</li>
  <li>Audio processing components</li>
  <li>Storage controllers</li>
</ul>

<p>Nearly everything in your Mac connects to or through the logic board. This means logic board problems can manifest as almost any symptom, from power failures to display issues to performance problems.</p>

<h2>Common Logic Board Problems</h2>

<p>Logic boards can fail in various ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Power circuit failures preventing startup</li>
  <li>GPU failures causing display problems</li>
  <li>Liquid damage corroding components</li>
  <li>Charging circuit failures affecting battery or power</li>
  <li>Component degradation from heat or age</li>
  <li>Physical damage from drops or impacts</li>
</ul>

<h2>Symptoms of Logic Board Issues</h2>

<p>Because the logic board handles so many functions, symptoms vary widely:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Mac won't turn on or randomly shuts down</li>
  <li>Display problems (no image, distortion, artifacts)</li>
  <li>Charging problems not caused by charger or battery</li>
  <li>USB ports or other connections not working</li>
  <li>Audio issues</li>
  <li>Random restarts or kernel panics</li>
  <li>Overheating without apparent cause</li>
</ul>

<h2>Repair Options</h2>

<p><strong>Apple's approach:</strong> Apple typically replaces the entire logic board when any component fails. This is reliable but expensive, often costing more than a used Mac of the same model.</p>

<p><strong>Component-level repair:</strong> Many logic board issues can be fixed by replacing individual failed components rather than the whole board. This requires specialized skills and equipment but can be significantly more economical. A failed charging chip, power management IC, or damaged capacitor can often be replaced individually.</p>

<p><strong>Used board replacement:</strong> Installing a tested used logic board is another option, often more economical than a new board while still restoring full functionality.</p>

<h2>When Is Repair Worthwhile?</h2>

<p>Whether logic board repair makes sense depends on the specific failure, the Mac's value, and repair costs. Simple component failures are often worth fixing. Extensive damage from liquid or severe physical damage may make repair uneconomical. Professional diagnosis can determine what's failed and whether repair is a sensible investment.</p>
