<h1>Flexgate</h1>

<p class="definition">Flexgate is a term used to describe a design flaw in certain 2016-2018 MacBook Pro models where the display flex cable wears out from repeated opening and closing of the lid. This causes backlight failure or display issues over time.</p>

<h2>What Causes Flexgate</h2>

<p>In affected MacBook Pro models, the display flex cable runs through the hinge area. The cable is thin and flexible to allow the lid to open and close, but this flexibility makes it vulnerable to wear. Every time you open or close your MacBook, this cable bends slightly. Over thousands of cycles, the cable develops breaks or damage.</p>

<p>The issue is primarily a design limitation. The cable was made shorter than in previous models, leaving less slack for the repeated flexing motion. This puts stress on specific points along the cable.</p>

<h2>Symptoms of Flexgate</h2>

<p>The most common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A "stage light" effect at the bottom of the screen where the backlight shines unevenly</li>
  <li>The screen going completely dark when opened past a certain angle</li>
  <li>Backlight flickering when opening or closing the lid</li>
  <li>Display working fine when the lid is at certain angles but failing at others</li>
  <li>Complete backlight failure (screen appears black but you can see a faint image with a flashlight)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Which Models Are Affected</h2>

<p>Flexgate primarily affects:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (2016, A1706 and A1708)</li>
  <li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (2017, A1706 and A1708)</li>
  <li>MacBook Pro 15-inch (2016, A1707)</li>
  <li>MacBook Pro 15-inch (2017, A1707)</li>
  <li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (2018, A1989) - some models</li>
</ul>

<p>Apple acknowledged this issue and extended repair coverage for certain models, though not all affected users qualified.</p>

<h2>Repair Options</h2>

<p>There are several approaches to fixing flexgate:</p>

<p><strong>Apple repair:</strong> If your model qualifies under Apple's extended program, repair may be covered. Otherwise, Apple typically replaces the entire display assembly.</p>

<p><strong>Display assembly replacement:</strong> Replacing the full display is straightforward but costly since it replaces more than just the cable.</p>

<p><strong>Cable repair:</strong> Some repair specialists can replace or repair just the flex cable, which is more economical than full display replacement. This requires careful work but addresses the actual failure point.</p>

<h2>Prevention</h2>

<p>If you have an affected model, there's no way to completely prevent flexgate, but you can reduce stress on the cable by avoiding repeatedly opening and closing the lid when not necessary. Keeping the MacBook open during use rather than constantly closing and reopening may extend the cable's life.</p>
