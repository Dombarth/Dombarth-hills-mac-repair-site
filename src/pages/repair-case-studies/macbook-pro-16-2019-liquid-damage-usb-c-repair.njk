<h1>MacBook Pro 16" 2019: USB-C Ports Not Working After Liquid Damage</h1>

<div class="case-meta">

<section class="case-overview">
<h2>What Happened</h2>
<p>This was a graphic designer from Castle Hill. Shed gotten some water on the keyboard, not alot apparently. Two of the USB-C ports on the left had stopped working completely and the other two were intermittent. Sometimes theyd charge sometimes they wouldnt. Thunderbolt wasnt being recognised on any of them.</p>

<p>Apple quoted $1,650 for a new logic board.</p>
</section>

<section class="case-symptoms">
<h2>What We Found</h2>
<p>Corrosion around the left side ports. Green deposits on a couple of the chips, the CD3215 USB-C controllers. The liquid indicators were triggered. The left controller was damaged and the right side one had corrosion starting on it aswell.</p>

<p>CPU and T2 looked fine.</p>
</section>

<section class="case-diagnosis">
<h2>The Repair</h2>
<p>Cleaned the board ultrasonically first then removed both CD3215 chips. Even though the right one was still partially working we replaced both. Two of the pads under the left controller had lifted so we ran some jumper wires.</p>

<p>Sourced replacement chips from a donor board. Once they were in we tested everything. All four ports working, Thunderbolt recognised, charging at full speed.</p>

<p>Heard from her about six months later everything still working.</p>
</section>

<section class="case-lessons">
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Apple quoted $1,650 for a logic board. The chips that actually failed cost about $25 each. She waited three weeks after the spill before bringing it in and by then the corrosion had spread from the left side to the right. See our <a href="/macbook-liquid-damage/">liquid damage guide</a> for more on this.</p>
