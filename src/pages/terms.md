# Terms, Warranty & Conditions

**Last updated:** February 2025  
**Applies to:** All repairs, diagnostics and services performed by Hills District Mac Repair.

Hills District Mac Repair is an independent technician service. **We are not affiliated with Apple Inc.**

All customers are required to read and accept the following terms before any work is performed.

---

## 1. Quotes & Estimates

- **Call for a free phone estimate** before bringing in your device.
- We provide upfront pricing guidance based on your device's symptoms.
- Final quotes are confirmed after inspection and diagnosis of the device.
- There is no obligation to proceed with repair after receiving a quote.

---

## 2. Repair Approval & Quotes

- All repair work requires express customer approval — verbal, SMS, email or written.
- Quotes marked "from $X" indicate starting prices only. Final pricing depends on model, damage, and parts availability.
- Prices may vary due to supplier stock, shipping costs, part quality or unforeseen component issues.
- You consent to standard repair processes including disassembly, cleaning, testing and parts installation.

---

## 3. Parts Used: New, Used, Aftermarket & Third-Party

We may offer:
- Brand new OEM-equivalent parts
- Used/Refurbished genuine Apple parts
- High-quality aftermarket replacements

You will be told which type is recommended before approving the repair.

### 3.1 Warranty Periods

| Part Type | Warranty Period |
|-----------|-----------------|
| New parts | 12-month warranty (defects only) |
| Used / refurbished / aftermarket parts | 30-day warranty |
| Customer-supplied parts | No warranty and no guarantee of fit or function |

### 3.2 Warranty Does NOT Cover

Warranty is strictly limited to the part we replaced. It does **not** cover:

- Accidental or physical damage
- Cracked screens
- Liquid or moisture ingress
- Electrical shorts
- Damage caused by power surges, brownouts, or unstable household power
- Overloading USB ports (including charging phones from a Mac's USB ports)
- Use of USB hubs, docks or 3rd-party chargers
- Logic board faults that damage a new part
- Faults unrelated to the repaired component
- Software corruption, malware or failed macOS updates
- Customer modification or tampering after repair

**If a replacement part fails due to any of the above, the warranty is void.**

---

## 4. NSW & Australian Consumer Law (ACL) Compliance

Under ACL, customers are entitled to:
- Services performed with due care and skill
- Services fit for their stated purpose
- Services performed within a reasonable time

Our warranty terms comply with ACL by clearly defining what is and is not covered, and by offering repair or replacement of faulty parts when the fault is due to workmanship or defective parts.

**ACL remedies do not apply when damage is caused by:**
- Pre-existing hardware faults
- User damage
- Environmental damage (heat, power, liquid)
- Third-party accessories or misuse
- Underlying logic board issues outside the scope of repair

---

## 5. Power-Related, Electrical & Environmental Risks

Many Apple Mac failures are caused by home power issues.

**The following immediately voids warranty:**
- Power surges, spikes or brownouts
- Unstable household wiring
- Charging phones or tablets from the Mac's USB ports
- Ongoing use of USB hubs, multi-chargers or docks
- Lightning damage
- Faulty power boards or cheap chargers
- Overheating due to blocked vents, dust or environment

You acknowledge that external electrical faults can destroy repaired components, and such damage is not covered.

---

## 6. Liquid Damage & Logic Board Issues

- Liquid damage is unpredictable and often causes progressive failure.
- Repairs to liquid-damaged devices carry no long-term guarantees.
- A repaired component may fail again if the logic board has underlying corrosion.
- Warranty applies only to the specific part replaced, not to future failures.

---

## 7. Data, Backups & Data Loss

- Customers are responsible for ensuring backups exist before repair.
- We do not guarantee the safety of stored data.
- Repairs may require system resets or component swaps which can cause data loss.
- **No liability is accepted for data loss, corruption or software-related issues.**

---

## 8. Device Handling, Risks & Technicians' Limitations

- Opening a Mac can expose existing or hidden faults that worsen once disassembled — this is normal.
- Older devices may have brittle cables, glued components or worn connectors which can break during safe repair procedures.
- We will take all reasonable care, but cannot be responsible for age-related or pre-existing component failure.

---

## 9. Returns & Refunds

- Refunds are not offered for completed successful repairs.
- Refunds do not apply when the customer changes their mind after repair.
- Warranty is repair-or-replace only, at technician discretion.

---

## 10. Warranty Claim Conditions

To make a claim:
- The device must be returned for inspection
- The original repair must be identifiable
- No third-party technicians must have opened the device after repair
- Device must be in the same configuration as delivered

If the inspection shows the failure was due to non-covered causes (damage, liquid, power, misuse), warranty is void.

---

## 11. Ownership, Abandonment & Storage

- Devices not collected within 30 days of repair completion or diagnostic outcome may be considered abandoned.
- Storage fees may apply after 30 days.
- Abandoned devices may be disposed of or recycled to recover costs.

---
