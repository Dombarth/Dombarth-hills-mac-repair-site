<h1>About the Technician</h1>

<p class="lead">Hills Mac Repair is operated by a technician with extensive hands-on experience diagnosing and repairing Apple computers. Every Mac that comes through our Hills District workshop is assessed and repaired with the same attention to detail and commitment to honest service.</p>

<section>
<h2>Background and Experience</h2>

<p>With years of experience working specifically on Apple hardware, I've seen thousands of Mac problems come through the door. From straightforward battery replacements to complex logic board repairs requiring component-level work, this experience has taught me that proper diagnosis is the foundation of every successful repair.</p>

<p>I started working on Macs because I appreciated the engineering. I've continued because helping people solve problems with their technology, protect their data, and avoid unnecessary expenses is genuinely satisfying work.</p>

<h2>Types of Repairs</h2>

<p>The repairs I handle span the full range of Mac issues:</p>
<ul>
  <li>MacBook and iMac hardware diagnostics</li>
  <li>Logic board repair at the component level</li>
  <li>Liquid damage assessment and restoration</li>
  <li>Battery replacement and power issues</li>
  <li>Display and screen repairs</li>
  <li>Storage upgrades and data recovery</li>
  <li>Startup problems and software issues</li>
  <li>Performance optimisation</li>
</ul>

<p>Component-level repair is something I take particular interest in. Where Apple's approach is to replace entire logic boards (often costing more than the Mac is worth), I can frequently repair the actual failed component for a fraction of the cost. This requires proper diagnostic equipment, board schematics, and micro-soldering skills, but it makes many repairs feasible that would otherwise be uneconomical.</p>

<h2>Diagnostic Philosophy</h2>

<p>My approach to Mac repair is based on a few core principles:</p>

<h3>Diagnosis First</h3>
<p>The repair you think you need and the repair you actually need are often different. I always diagnose properly before recommending any work. This means understanding the actual cause, not just treating symptoms.</p>

<h3>Honest Assessment</h3>
<p>Not every Mac is worth repairing. Not every repair makes economic sense. I'll tell you what's wrong, what it would cost to fix, and whether I think repair is the right choice for your situation. If repair doesn't make sense, I'll say so.</p>

<h3>Data Protection</h3>
<p>Your data is usually more valuable than the Mac itself. I treat data protection as a priority, not an afterthought. If a repair risks your data, I'll discuss this before proceeding. If data recovery is needed, that typically comes before any repair work.</p>

<h3>No Unnecessary Work</h3>
<p>I don't believe in replacing parts that don't need replacing or selling services that won't solve your problem. This might mean less revenue for me, but it means better outcomes for you.</p>

<h2>Continuing Development</h2>

<p>Mac technology changes constantly. New models bring new challenges, new repair techniques become available, and the industry evolves. I invest in ongoing training, updated equipment, and staying current with both Apple's changes and the broader independent repair community's developments.</p>

<p>This means being able to work on the latest M-series MacBooks as well as older Intel machines, understanding the security implications of T2 chips and Apple Silicon, and adapting repair approaches as Apple's hardware designs change.</p>

<section>
<h2>Workshop-Based Service</h2>

<p>Hills Mac Repair is a workshop-based service, not mobile. All repairs are done at my Hills District workshop where I have the proper equipment for diagnostics and component-level work. Ultrasonic cleaning, hot air rework stations, microscopes, and proper ESD protection aren't things you can bring to someones house.</p>

<p>This workshop approach means I can offer repairs that mobile services cant. Logic board component replacement, proper liquid damage cleaning, and precision work all require a proper workbench setup. The tradeoff is that you need to bring your Mac to me rather than me coming to you.</p>

<section>
<h2>Hills District Focus</h2>

<p>Operating in the Hills District means serving a community Im part of. Many customers come through word of mouth, returning with their next problem or referring friends and family. This local focus keeps me accountable in a way that anonymous corporate service centres arent.</p>

<p>If something isnt right with a repair you can come back and talk to the same person who did the work. I stand behind what I do.</p>
